# Top-Performers-Bot

In this personal project, I am developing a Telegram Bot that will display newly created tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that meet a certain criteria and are sorted in terms of current market capitalisation and 'all-time high'. Each token is filtered through a scam check using Honeypot.is (https://honeypot.is/) before being displayed on the Telegram output, this does not guarantee that any of the tokens are not a scam, but is helpful in filtering out the more obvious ones.

Currently, the Top Performers Bot supports results for 4 blockchains: ETH, BSC, BASE, and ARB. Additionally, it can display results for tokens created in the last: 24 hours, 12 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour. Development is continuing and I intend to add more features and supported blockchains.

The bot was created initially for myself, replacing research that would have taken a long time with the click of a button. However, people have suggested that I could monetise this idea with extra features that are only avaialble for premium members or subscribers, for example. For that reason, most of the code will not be publicly available on this repository, however photos, video demonstrations, and code snippets will be uploaded.
